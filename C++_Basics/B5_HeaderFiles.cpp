There are two types of header files :
1. System header file - It comes with the compiler
2. User header file   - It is written by the programmer
*/

//1. System header file
#include<iostream>  

//2. User header file
// #include"riri.h"  --> this will produce an error if 'riri.h' is not present in the current directory.
